Hi, I am Mircea.
 
I work as network engineer for [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and I spend most of my time writing code for network automation.
 
Sometimes I give talks at conferences such as [RIPE](https://ripe72.ripe.net/presentations/58-RIPE72-Network-Automation-with-Salt-and-NAPALM-Mircea-Ulinic-CloudFlare.pdf) or [NANOG](https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/NANOG68%20Network%20Automation%20with%20Salt%20and%20NAPALM%20Mircea%20Ulinic%20Cloudflare%20(1).pdf) about the stuff I've built and how network automation really helps to maintain reliable and stable one of the biggest global networks.
 
Back in time I begun as software developer, particularly for web backend. [Learning Python, 2nd edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002817.do) was the first serious book I read and today Python is the programming language I use the most. However, Ruby is still my favourite, although I can't say I have extensive experience.
 
Before my university studies, I took a drastic decision over my career path and decided to make a sudden change. Although I was always fascinated about telecom, both radio and cable based transmissions, this was something totally new for me - barely I knew what a MAC address is. After several years of hard work I recuperated these drawbacks, and I still got tons of things to learn everyday.
 
I had the chance to experience the life in Switzerland, at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), where I've been researching around parallel computing. Next stop was France where I applied some automation methodologies in the core of a service provider called [iBrowse](http://www.ibrowse.com/) covering few countries in Europe. Latest country is now UK, being based in Cloudflare's London office.
 
Besides networking I am very passionate about radio communications (especially mobile networks), mathematics and algorithms.
